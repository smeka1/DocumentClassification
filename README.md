# DocumentClassification

This is a Document classification application built using Python.
The model was trained using scikit-learn library tools. The model was deployed to AWS and the URL is:
http://ec2-35-163-232-2.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3001/api

This page has two links. The first is for getting a URL where a request can be sent via commandline or web tools that do POST and GET. 
The second link is for a human to paste his input and submit it. It makes a POST request from the HTML form and gives back the predicted model.
